# startpage

### ⚠️ Work In Progress ⚠️
**Inspiration:** <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages/">r/startpages</a> on Reddit

Created this to add as my default start page when I open a new window/tab in my broswer. Ideally it'll have everything I need on it.

#### Features to include:
- [x] Personalized Greeting

- [x] Accurate Date

- [x] Accurate Local Weather (no need for input, use location)

- [x] Have personalized workout routine for the day

- [ ] Implement AQI (Air Quality Index)

- [ ] Have a motivational quote at the bottom depending on the day

- [ ] Implement <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia's Main Page</a> "In the news" features section (use their <a href="https://api.wikimedia.org/wiki/API_reference/Feed/Featured_content">API</a>)
